DayZRedux
=========
A variant of DayZ Mod intended to be more brutal and unforgiving.


Prerequisites
=============

 - Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008
 - A working ArmA 2 Combined Ops dedicated server with latest ARMA2:OA BETA patch installed.
 - Strawberry Perl
 - MySQL Community Server

Known Bugs
==========
 - Ammo refills on logout/login.  This side-effect occurs as a result of an anti-dupe fix.  Ammo refill seems to be the lesser evil.
 - Sometimes a combat logger does not leave a body behind.  If you can replicate this reliably, please let me know the steps to do so.  Note that, regardless, the combat logger is always killed properly in the database.
